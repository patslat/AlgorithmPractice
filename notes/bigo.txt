BIG THETA
for a given function g(n), we denote by THETA(g(n)) = {f(n) : there
exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0 such that 0 <= c1g(n) <= f(n) <=
c2g(N) for all n >= n0}
THETA means f(n) can be sandwiched between c1g(n) and c2g(n)

THETA binds a function from above and below

BIG O is an asymptotic upper bound

O(g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 such
that 0 <= f(n) <= cg(n) for all n >= n0}

BIG OMEGA is the asymptotic lower bound
OMEGA(g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constraints c and n0 such
that 0 <= cg(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0}
