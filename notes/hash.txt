# direct addressing works well when the universe U of keys is reasonably  small
#
# a direct address table is an array where each slot corresponds to a single
# key in U
#
# Hash table
# handle collisions with chaining
# given a hash table T with m slots that stores n elements, we define a load
# factor alpha for T as n/m, that is the average number of elements sotred
# in a chain.
#
# Worst case performance of a hash table is big theta(n), all n keys hash to
# the same slot.
#
# simple uniform hashing: assumption that any given element is equally likely
# to hash into any of the m slots, independently of where any other element
# is hashed
#
# time required to search for any element k depends lineraly on the length of
# nsubh(k) of the list T[h(k)].
